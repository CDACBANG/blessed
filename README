Bluetooth Low Energy Software Stack for Embedded Devices

This is an open source project targeting Bluetooth Low Energy
communication for embedded devices. Usage of proprietary library is
not encouraged.

For NRF51822, SoftDevice device library creates abstraction for Bluetooth
Radio and GATT procedures. The available examples in this project are not
linking against any NRF library, the radio is being controlled directly
without proprietary libraries.

* How-to build:

At the moment only NRF51822 is supported, support for ubertooth is on the
roadmap.

Change NRF51_SDK_PATH (see platform/nrf51822/Makefile.platform) to your
SDK path directory

In the project root directory, build the stack, and platform core libraries
$ make PLATFORM=nrf51822

Inside the examples:
$ make PLATFORM=nrf51822

* How-to flash:
